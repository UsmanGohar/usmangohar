Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University (ISU). I received my M.Sc from the University of Minneosta and my B.Eng. degree from National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST). My research interests are broadly at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning, with a particular focus on Fairness in AI, social computing, and AI for social good.
